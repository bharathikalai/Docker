*** A Docker container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained unit of software that packages an application and its dependencies. Here's a simple explanation: ***

## Key Points:
            _Isolated Environment: Containers run in isolation from other containers and the host system, meaning they don't interfere with each other._

            _Runs Anywhere: Since containers include all the necessary code, libraries, and settings, they can run on any system that supports Docker, making them very portable._

            _Lightweight: Unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers share the host system’s operating system kernel, so they are more efficient and use fewer resources._

_Docker container command_

```
sudo docker run python-helloworld:latest

```
