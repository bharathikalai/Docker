# A Docker container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained unit of software that packages an application and its dependencies. Here's a simple explanation

## Key Points:

### Isolated Environment: _Containers run in isolation from other containers and the host system, meaning they don't interfere with each other._

### Runs Anywhere: _Since containers include all the necessary code, libraries, and settings, they can run on any system that supports Docker, making them very portable._

### Lightweight: _Unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers share the host systemâ€™s operating system kernel, so they are more efficient and use fewer resources._
