# Docker Network 

### Docker networks enable communication between Docker containers, and between containers and the outside world. Containers can be isolated or connected using different network types depending on the requirements of your application. Docker provides several built-in network types to manage container communication effectively.

## Types of Docker Networks:

- __Bridge Network__
- __Host Network__
- __Overlay Network__
- __Macvlan Network__
- __None Network__
