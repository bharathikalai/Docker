# Docker Cli

The Docker CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a tool used to interact with Docker. It allows you to manage Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes through a command-line interface.

Key Docker CLI commands include:

docker run: Run a container from an image.
docker build: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
docker ps: List running containers.
docker images: List Docker images.
docker stop: Stop a running container.
docker exec: Run a command inside a running container.
The Docker CLI is essential for managing Docker environments efficiently through terminal commands.

# Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository where Docker users can store and share container images. It is essentially a centralized platform for finding and distributing Docker images.

Key features of Docker Hub include:

Public and Private Repositories: Users can store their images publicly (accessible to everyone) or privately (accessible only to specific users).
Pre-Built Images: Docker Hub provides a vast collection of pre-built images for popular software like databases, web servers, and programming languages.
Automated Builds: You can set up automated builds that trigger whenever you push new code to a GitHub or Bitbucket repository.
Official Images: Docker Hub hosts "official images" for popular projects, verified and maintained by Docker.
Image Versioning: Docker Hub allows users to version images, making it easy to track different releases of an image.
In short, Docker Hub simplifies sharing, storing, and managing Docker images.
